 * Focus survives a slide change in reader mode (docs/PRD-perf.md, P2-A11Y M2). The reader pill is
 * rendered by the stage, which remounts per slide, so the button that had focus is destroyed by
 * the move it started. Before the move the stage records which pill control had focus (its
 * `data-control`); the next stage focuses the same control on mount, as `focusOnArrival` does for
 * the drawer. A control that is disabled on the new slide (Next on the last one) hands focus to
 * the stage instead, so it never falls to `<body>`.
