 * the same moment is announced unreliably (NVDA, JAWS), which is why `ensureAnnouncer()` runs on
 * arrival, well before the first message.
 *
 * Slide titles are not announced here: Next's route announcer reads the new page's title on every
 * navigation. This region carries step changes in reader mode.
