/**
 * Carries the presenter's key or pointer press to a frame that loads after it (design review,
 * item 7). WebKit 26.0 ignores element.focus() in a cross-origin frame without user activation,
 * and it forwards activation to a frame only through a postMessage made in a task that descends
 * from the input (a timer started during the event). A fresh document's `ready` arrives as a
 * message event, which carries none, so a reset and replay would restore no focus.
 *
 * A press in this window, or a key the focused frame forwards, opens a one second window with a timer chain started inside the event; `withInput`
 * runs its callback on the next tick of that chain, so the replay is posted from a task that
 * still carries the press. Without a press (the speaker window drove the step) it runs at once.
 * Other engines need none of this and behave the same either way.
 *
 * The limit: WebKit honours the press only while the frame handles the message and in timers it
 * starts. Focus a page moves later, after a fetch or an animation frame, has no press behind it in
 * a fresh document, so WebKit 26.0 keeps it on the previous element. The runtime then asks again
 * (`focus-request`), and the handle answers with `focus-grant` through `withInput`, so the second
 * try carries the press while its window is open (review r7 M2). A forward run has the real key
 * press inside the frame and restores focus as authored.
